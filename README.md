# Delve-and-Dine
The name is a place holder for now. This project will be a text based dungeon diving rpg, with a theme and focus on gathering ingredients to cook with. Either for yourself or your shop.

As I have worked on this project I realized the scope of ideas/features that I would like to implement would be greatly out of scope of the initial purpose of this project. This was only meant to be 20 - 40 hour project in order to get some practical experience working on an original personal project. So with the being said I have decided reign in the scope and make this the a very early PoC. So in this current iteration I have focused mainly on creating the foundational aspects such as:

- classes (for characters, items and inventory)
- the user input functionality which allows for a selection base interface instead of only stand key inputs
- Basic Combat loop
- Basic Game flow

Things I would like to implement in the future would be:

- Making the game flow dynamic instead of narrative text directly hard-coded to the main function 
- Adding a leveling and experience system
- Adding special attacks to utilize the stamina stat
- Adding cooking mechanic
- Adding a gameplay flow to sell and cook items at the end of a run
-
